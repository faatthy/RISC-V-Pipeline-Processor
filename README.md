RISC-V (pronounced "risk-five") is an open-standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on the principles of Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC). It was designed with simplicity and modularity in mind, making it ideal for a wide range of applications from microcontrollers to high-performance computing systems.

A pipeline processor in RISC-V architecture allows for efficient and high-speed execution of instructions by overlapping the execution of multiple instructions. This is achieved by breaking down the execution process into several stages, with each stage handling a different part of the instruction.
